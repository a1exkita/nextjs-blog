In the age of the internet, information overload is a serious issue we are only just beginning to comprehend. Individuals who simply want to learn the bare minimum to achieve their goals are often overwhelmed with material, both reputable and not. To combat this issue, a website was designed that allows users to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Mentory is an innovative online platform where customers are matched with industry experts that will meet with them face-to-face to develop a customized plan that fulfills their unique needs. 

Mentory is a NextJS application to achieve fast page transitions by utilizing static generation. I am responsible for backend development including managing database and deployment environment. We used Strapi + MySQL to manage our data. Also, we use Vercel for frontend app and Heroku for backend app as deployement environments.
