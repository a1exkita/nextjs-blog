Kabi is a popular restaurant in Meguro, Tokyo. I worked on this project as a web developer and a designer. The design is minimal to be matched with the brand concept of the restaurant. Also, it is responsive mobile-first design based on the fact that most users made reservations on their smart phones. I used Wordpress as its CMS so that they can post their blogs by themselves.
